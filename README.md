# LINE Bot and Pre-ordering  

## Description  
In our microeconomics class, we used LINE to promote products and managed an OpenChat with five admins who took turns replying to customer messages. Even though it wasnâ€™t always my turn, customers kept tagging me, and then someone else would answer, which felt really weird. So, I built a LINE Bot that collects all the tags and sends out clear responses, making our chat way more organized and easier for everyone to follow.

## Features  

- LINE Messaging Integration: Seamless communication with users via the LINE platform.  
- Pre-order System: Enables customers to place orders in advance.  
- Real-time Notifications: Keeps users informed about their order status instantly.  
- Admin Dashboard: Allows administrators to monitor and manage orders efficiently.  

## Usage  

1. Add the LINE bot by scanning its QR code in the LINE app.  
2. Send a message to the bot to start the ordering process.  
3. Follow the prompts to complete your pre-order.  
4. For administrators, access the management interface through the designated URL and log in with your credentials.  

## Project Structure  

The project is organized into several main directories and key files:  

- **Application Directory**: Contains business logic, models, and views.  
- **Project Configuration**: Includes settings and URL configurations.  
- **Static Files**: Holds stylesheets, JavaScript, and other static assets.  
- **Templates**: Stores HTML templates for rendering views.  
- **Database File**: The database used for storing order information.  
- **Entry Script**: The main script to manage the project.  
- **Dependency List**: A file specifying all required dependencies.  
- **Deployment Configuration**: Settings for deploying the application to cloud services.
